9,How does exception handling work in C#?,Exception handling in C# is done using try, catch, finally, and throw keywords.

The 'finally' block is executed whether an exception is thrown or not.
10,What is the difference between 'var' and 'dynamic' in C#?,'var' is used for implicitly typed local variables, and the type is determined at compile time. 'dynamic' is a type introduced in C# 4.0 that represents a dynamic type, and its type is resolved at runtime. It provides more flexibility but lacks compile-time checking.,,
